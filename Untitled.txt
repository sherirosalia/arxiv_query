My father's mental condition has made his physical condition dangerous. 


The deterioration of his mental faculties and aggressive progression in dementia has endangered his physical. 

Peeing pants
Collapsing on walks for months
Now he's Hallucinating 
Won't tell us difficulty eating.

Ripping out his chemo bag.

Want a full neurological exam while he is in there and 

advocating that he goes to a rehab.
